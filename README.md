# RockPaperScissors

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The game allows a player to compete against the computer, and the results of each game, along with the overall score, are saved to a text file called `RPSResults.txt`. The choices made by the computer are choosen randomly using the "random" module.

## Features
- **Animated Countdown:**   The game includes a brief animation before revealing the winner.
- **Score Tracking:**       The player's and computer's scores are tracked and displayed after each round.
- **Result Logging:**       All game results and scores are saved in `RPSResults.txt`.
- **ANSI Escape Codes:**    Colors and text formatting in the terminal are achieved using ANSI escape codes.
